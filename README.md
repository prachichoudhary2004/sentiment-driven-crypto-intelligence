## 💡 Key Findings

> These are the primary behavioral insights the platform surfaces across trader segments.

**The Overconfidence Trap** — Peak profitability often occurs during Fear regimes, while Greed environments frequently become overconfidence traps that encourage poor risk management and excessive leverage usage.

**The Leverage Fallacy** — Low-leverage traders consistently outperform highly leveraged participants on a risk-adjusted basis, despite generating lower gross returns.

**Asymmetric Tail Risk** — Fear regimes demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns and lower downside exposure compared with euphoric market environments.

**Behavioral Bias Impact** — FOMO, overconfidence, panic selling, and loss chasing significantly influence profitability outcomes and risk exposure across all trader segments.

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 🧠 Behavioral Finance Intelligence

Detects and quantifies trader behavioral biases in real time:

- **Trader Persona Discovery** — unsupervised segmentation of trader archetypes
- **Behavioral Risk Scoring** — composite score per trader based on bias exposure
- **FOMO Detection** — identifies momentum-chasing entries under sentiment pressure
- **Overconfidence Detection** — flags disproportionate position sizing relative to edge
- **Loss Chasing Identification** — detects revenge trading patterns after drawdowns
- **Panic Selling Analysis** — identifies capitulation exits at unfavorable prices
- **Risk Profiling & Trader Classification** — maps traders to behavioral risk tiers

### 📈 Quantitative Risk Analytics

Full suite of institutional-grade risk metrics computed per trader and per portfolio:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| VaR | Value-at-Risk at configurable confidence levels |
| CVaR | Conditional Value-at-Risk (Expected Shortfall) |
| Sharpe Ratio | Return per unit of total volatility |
| Sortino Ratio | Return per unit of downside deviation |
| Calmar Ratio | Return relative to maximum drawdown |
| Maximum Drawdown | Peak-to-trough equity decline |
| Downside Deviation | Volatility of negative returns only |
| Rolling Risk Metrics | Time-windowed versions of all metrics above |
| Kelly Criterion | Optimal position sizing given historical edge |
| Risk Budgeting | Portfolio-level allocation by risk contribution |
